According to lore, Philibert Guichet, whose family purchased the restaurant from founders Guillaume and Marie Tujague in the 1910s, invented the cocktail while in New York City for a cocktail competition 'similar to what they have now for Tales of the Cocktail,' Latter says. Guichet's combination of equal parts cr\u00e8me de menthe, cr\u00e8me de cacao, and cream took second prize in the contest, and Guichet proudly brought the drink \u2014 supposedly named a 'Grasshopper' for its bright green color \u2014 back to New Orleans.  Eater has a [great writeup](http://www.eater.com/2014/10/23/7036159/a-brief-history-of-the-grasshopper) on it.",
