    "information": "Cura\u00e7ao (/\u02c8kj\u028a\u0259r\u0259sa\u028a/ KEWR-\u0259-sow) is a liqueur flavored with the dried peel of the laraha citrus fruit, grown on the island of Cura\u00e7ao. A non-native plant similar to an orange, the laraha developed from the sweet Valencia orange transplanted by Spanish explorers. The nutrient-poor soil and arid climate of Cura\u00e7ao proved unsuitable to Valencia cultivation, resulting in small, bitter fruit of the trees. Although the bitter flesh of the Laraha is all but inedible, the peels are aromatic and flavorful, maintaining much of the essence of the Valencia orange.\nCura\u00e7ao liqueur was first developed and marketed by the Senior family in the 19th century. To create the liqueur the laraha peel is dried, bringing out the sweetly fragranced oils. After soaking in a still with alcohol and water for several days, the peel is removed and other spices are added.\n\nThe liqueur has an orange-like flavor with varying degrees of bitterness. It is naturally colorless, but is often given artificial coloring, most commonly blue or orange, which confers an exotic appearance to cocktails and other mixed drinks. Blue color is achieved by adding of food colorant, most often E133 Brilliant Blue.\nSome other liqueurs are also sold as Cura\u00e7aos with different flavors added, such as coffee, chocolate, and rum and raisin.",
