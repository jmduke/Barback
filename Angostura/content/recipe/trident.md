There were very few recipes which specifically called for it, and I felt that there was plenty of room therefore for a few more. I had recently found that switching in aquavit for the gin in a Negroni produced great results, and thought I'd take this a little further. Since I have a facination for slightly obscure ingredients, I decided to try a Negroni variation in which each ingredient was something you might not typically find in ordinary bars.*",
