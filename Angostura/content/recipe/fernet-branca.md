The bitters are made from 27 herbs and other ingredient. The exact formula is a trade secret known only to the Fernet-Branca president, Niccol\u00f2 Branca, who personally measures out the aromatics during the production process. Fernet-Branca has enjoyed a recent growth in popularity in the United States particularly due to an increase in the interest in and mixing/serving of 'vintage' cocktails.",
