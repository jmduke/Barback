According to Beachbum Berry, J. \u201cPopo\u201d Galsini named the X-15 in honor of Douglas Aircraft engineers that drank at the Kona Kai, however according to the Wikipedia article on the X-15 rocket plane it was not manufactured by Douglas Aircraft, but North American Aviation in Los Angeles, CA and Reaction Motors in New Jersey. That said, North American Aviation was initially run by James H. \u201cDutch\u201d Kindelberger, who was recruited from the Douglas Aircraft Company, so it seems possible that he brought a number of engineers along with him and that it is these engineers referenced in this story. J. \u201cPopo\u201d Galsini renamed the X-15 to the Saturn in 1967 following a tragic accident during X-15 Flight 191 resulting in the death of U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Michael J.
