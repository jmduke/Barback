          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>The Hanky Panky originated at the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London in the early 20th century. Developed by head bartender Ada Coleman, the Hanky Panky matches Fernet-Branca&rsquo;s distinctive character with the botanicals found in gin and sweet vermouth to create a rich blend of flavors&ndash;a blend that lets the pushy liqueur remind you of its better side.</p>
        

        
          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <p>Combine ingredients in a mixing glass and fill with ice. Stir well for 20 seconds and strain into chilled cocktail glass.</p>
