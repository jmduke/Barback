        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>The origins of the Fanciulli cocktail are somewhat dim, but the flavor certainly isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a Manhattan with a bitter menthol backbone. The drink first appears in the 1931 book, Old Waldorf Bar Days, by Albert Stevens Crockett, and Mr. Crockett states that the name is Italian slang for &lsquo;our boys&rsquo;.</p>
