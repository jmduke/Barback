The nutrient-poor soil and arid climate of Curaçao proved unsuitable to Valencia cultivation, resulting in small, bitter fruit of the trees.

To create the liqueur the laraha peel is dried, bringing out the sweetly fragranced oils. After soaking in a still with alcohol and water for several days, the peel is removed and other spices are added.\n\nThe liqueur has an orange-like flavor with varying degrees of bitterness. It is naturally colorless, but is often given artificial coloring, most commonly blue or orange, which confers an exotic appearance to cocktails and other mixed drinks. Blue color is achieved by adding of food colorant, most often E133 Brilliant Blue.\nSome other liqueurs are also sold as Curaçaos with different flavors added, such as coffee, chocolate, and rum and raisin.","name":"Orange Curaçao","slug":"orange-curacao","type":"liqueur"},{"abv":0,"brands":[],"cocktaildb":"","information":"","name":"Honey","slug":"honey","type":"other"},{"abv":24,"brands":[],"cocktaildb":"http://www.cocktaildb.com/ingr_detail?id=150","color":"DFAFAE","information":"","name":"Cherry liqueur","slug":"cherry-liqueur","type":"liqueur"},{"abv":25,"brands":[],"cocktaildb":"","color":"D3E9CC","information":"Pimm's is a brand of fruit cups, but may also be considered a liqueur.

Unfortunately, starting in the in the 1860s, Europe's vineyards were decimated by the phylloxera plague, which severely curtailed the availability of Cognac for the original Sazerac. It was around this time that the Sazerac that we know today finally took shape, as a Thomas (John?) H.

          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>Sloe gin is a red liqueur made with gin and sloe (blackthorn) drupes, which are a small fruit relative of the plum. Sloe gin has an alcohol content between 15 and 30 percent by volume. However, the European Union has established a minimum of 25% abv for sloe gin to be named as such. The traditional way of making sloe gin is to soak the sloes in gin. Sugar is required to ensure the sloe juice is extracted from the fruit.</p>
