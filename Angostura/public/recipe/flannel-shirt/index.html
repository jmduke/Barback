          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>Bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler of the Clyde Common in Portland, Oregon, created the Flannel Shirt for an autumnal event. Using classic fall flavors &ndash; apple, earth, spice and smoke &ndash; he whipped up this fleecy, bone-warming drink with the bold backbone of Scotch and a wonderful supporting cast. Morgenthaler says, &ldquo;It reminds me of a hot drink that you&rdquo;d have on Thanksgiving morning &ndash; only served cold.&rdquo;</p>
        

        
          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <p>Combine in a cocktail shaker or mixing glass. Shake with ice cubes and strain into old-fashioned glass with cracked ice. Twist an orange peel over the surface of the cocktail and drop in the drink to serve.</p>
