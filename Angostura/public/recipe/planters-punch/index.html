          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>To quote the magazine <em>Fun</em>, in 1878:</p>

<p>A wine-glass with lemon juice fill,
Of sugar the same glass fill twice
Then rub them together until
The mixture looks smooth, soft, and nice.</p>

<p>Of rum then three wine glasses add,
And four of cold water please take. A
Drink then you&rsquo;ll have that&rsquo;s not badâ€”
At least, so they say in Jamaica.</p>
        

        
          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <p>Pour all ingredients, except the bitters, into shaker filled with ice. Shake. Pour into large glass, filled with ice. Add Angostura bitters, &ldquo;on top&rdquo;.</p>
