        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>In 1898 Democratic political czar Martin M. Lomasney hoped to capture a seat in the state&rsquo;s legislature, the General Court of Massachusetts. Lomasney held considerable power in the city for nearly 50 years. The story goes that the drink was created to honor his election, and the city&rsquo;s Ward 8 which historically delivered him a winning margin.  (You&rsquo;re supposed to garnish it with a miniature Massachusetts flag, too &ndash; but those are kinda hard to chase down.)</p>
