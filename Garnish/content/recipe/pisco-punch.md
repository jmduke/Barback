    "information": "The Pisco Punch is considered a classic cocktail, crucial to the history of San Francisco. It was invented by Duncan Nicol at a bar named Bank Exchange at the end of the 19th century, in SF; the original recipe was so potent that one writer of the day wrote *it tastes like lemonade but comes back with the kick of a roped steer.*  The drink gained notoriety thanks to pieces written by travelers including Mark Twain and Harold Ross. In Rudyard Kipling's 1889 epic *From Sea to Sea*, he immortalized Pisco Punch as being *compounded of the shavings of cherub's wings, the glory of a tropical dawn, the red clouds of sunset and the fragments of lost epics by dead masters*.",
