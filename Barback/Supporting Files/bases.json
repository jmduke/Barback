The family eventually sold the company to Martini and Rossi, which was in turn bought by Bacardi.\nThe recipe is a closely guarded trade secret, purportedly known to only three people at any given time. So many people have tried to reproduce it that the company maintains on its grounds in F\u00e9camp a \"Hall of Counterfeits\" (Salle des Contrefa\u00e7ons). The bottle and label have been imitated, as has the name B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine. The company prosecuted those it felt to be infringing on its intellectual property.\nThe manufacturing process involves several distillations which are then blended.\nThe same company also produces \"B & B\" (or B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine and Brandy), which is B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine diluted with brandy, making it less sweet than B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine. B & B was developed in the 1930s when consumers began a trend of mixing B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine with brandy to produce a drier taste. Both B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine and B&B are 40% alcohol (80 proof) by volume. Until recently, both B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine and B & B were 43% alcohol (86 proof). In 1977, the company introduced a 60 proof (30% alcohol) coffee liqueur, Caf\u00e9 B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, a blend of B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine and a coffee-flavoured liqueur, however, Caf\u00e9 B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine is no longer produced or available. Additionally, the company produces a B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine Single Cask. B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine Single Cask comes in a unique black bottle and is only available at the Palais de la B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine's store in F\u00e9camp, Normandy, France.\nEvery bottle of B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine has the initials D.O.M. on the label, which stands for \"Deo Optimo Maximo\" (\"To God, most good, most great\").

Burnley Football Club also sell Benedictine on match days, making them the only English club to do this.\nBesides the B & B, cocktails using B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine include the Frisco, Derby, Singapore Sling, Vieux Carr\u00e9, Cornell Special, and Monte Carlo.", "cocktaildb": "", "name": "DOM B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine", "objectId": "lG5c3JcSZj", "brands": [], "type": "liqueur", "abv": 40}, {"information": "Champagne is a sparkling wine produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation.", "cocktaildb": "http://www.cocktaildb.com/ingr_detail?id=432", "name": "Champagne", "objectId": "1rmTvIbxLv", "brands": [], "type": "mixer", "abv": 12}, {"information": "Disaronno Originale (28% abv) is a brand of fruity amaretto, with a characteristic bittersweet almond taste.

After soaking in a still with alcohol and water for several days, the peel is removed and other spices are added.\n\nThe liqueur has an orange-like flavor with varying degrees of bitterness.
