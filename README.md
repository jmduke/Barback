An app for drinking cocktails, ported to Swift.

It looks like this (for now):

More details can be found [here](http://getbarback.com).  Obviously this guy isn't on the App Store yet, as Swift apps can't be submitted, but it will be!

Feel free to browse, criticize, offer input, post gifs, etc.  Especially if you know of a cocktail I'm missing :).
