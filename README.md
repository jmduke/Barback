Barback
=======

## Intro

An app for drinking cocktails, written in Swift.  Currently on v2.3, as of Dec. 6th.

More technically: it's a CRUD Swift app under active development which is almost entirely open-sourced (I try and hide things like the recipes themselves and, you know, private keys.)  The issues on GitHub are what I'm working on; the code is evolving with my familiarity with Swift and the larger iOS ecosystem (which is to say, frequently and slowly.)

## Stack

- Swift, duh.
- Parse, for literally everything.  Recipes, ingredients, and all sorts of fun data is stored in Parse.  Crashes, analytics, and configurations are stored in Parse.
- A variety of Pods for front-end stuff.  Most of this is stuff I should port over to my own ends at some point, but DRY and all that jank.

## So...

In conclusion, Barback is an app that lets you make drinks that look like this:

More details can be found [here](http://getbarback.com), and you can buy it on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barback-classic-modern-cocktails/id829469529?mt=8).  There's also a [frontend portion](www.getbarback.com/recipe/Draughtsman) which is under active development.

Feel free to browse, criticize, offer input, post gifs, etc.  Especially if you know of a cocktail I'm missing :).
