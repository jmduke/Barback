- name: Hanky Panky
  ingredients:
  - 4.5cl Gin
  - 4.5cl Sweet vermouth
  - Fernet-Branca (two dashes)
  garnish: Orange peel
  directions: "Combine ingredients in a mixing glass and fill with ice. Stir well for 20 seconds and strain into chilled cocktail glass."
  glassware: cocktail
  information: "The Hanky Panky originated at the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London in the early 20th century. Developed by head bartender Ada Coleman, the Hanky Panky matches Fernet-Branca's distinctive character with the botanicals found in gin and sweet vermouth to create a rich blend of flavors--a blend that lets the pushy liqueur remind you of its better side."
- name: Decolletage
  ingredients:
  - 4.5cl Tequila (Reposado)
  - 3cl Dubonnet Rouge
  - 1.5cl Aperol
  - 1cl Fernet-Branca

  glassware: old fashioned
  information: "This recipe from Chris Hannah of French 75 Bar in New Orleans was chosen as one of the 101 Best New Cocktails to be included in Gaz Regan's 2011 Annual Manual for Bartenders. It's fragrant and slightly mentholated, with hints of sweet orange and cinnamony spice. Not for the timid, but seductive all the same."
- name: Toronto
  ingredients:
  - 6cl Rye
  - 1cl Fernet-Branca
  - 1cl Simple syrup
  - Angostura bitters (Two dashes)
  garnish: Orange peel
  glassware: cocktail
  directions: "Combine rye, Fernet, simple syrup, and bitters in a mixing glass and fill with cracked ice. Stir for 20 seconds and strain into chilled cocktail glass."
  information: "Here's a cocktail that helps the Fernet-Branca-curious start off gently. Pairing the Italian bitter with the crispness of rye whiskey and softening the blow with sugar, the Toronto Cocktail keeps the Fernet from dominating the show. In the same flavor realm as the Boulevardier, the Toronto is a richly flavored, mildly bitter cocktail that also pairs perfectly with a crisp autumn evening."
- name: Eeyore's Requiem
  glassware: coupe
  directions: "Fill a mixing glass with ice, add Campari, Tanqueray, Cynar, Fernet, vermouth, and bitters. Stir until well chilled and strain into serving glass."
  information: "If you sat around naming all the bitter ingredients in your liquor cabinet, you might come close to the formula for this Anti-Valentine's Day tipple. Eeyore's Requiem, invented by Toby Maloney of Chicago's Violet Hour, starts with Campari, then adds a dose of Fernet-Branca, which is made with gentian, chamomile, bitter orange, myhrr, and saffron, among other things. Not bitter enough for your cynical heart? Maloney takes your Fernet and your Campari and raises you a quarter ounce of artichoke-and-herb based Cynar."
  ingredients:
  - 4.5cl Campari
  - 1.5cl Gin
  - .5cl Cynar
  - .5cl Fernet-Branca
  - 3cl Vermouth (Blanc)
  - "Orange bitters (Fifteen drops.  Yes, fifteen.)"
  garnish: Orange twist
- name: Fanciulli
  glassware: cocktail
  directions: 'Pour the whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Fernet-Branca into a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir until outside of mixing glass is very cold to touch, about 15 seconds.'
  information: "The origins of the Fanciulli cocktail are somewhat dim, but the flavor certainly isn't. It's a Manhattan with a bitter menthol backbone. The drink first appears in the 1931 book, Old Waldorf Bar Days, by Albert Stevens Crockett, and Mr. Crockett states that the name is Italian slang for 'our boys'."

  information: 'The Obituary is an intriguing spin on a gin martini, probably getting its morbid name from the inclusion of absinthe (though a pastis like Pernod can be substituted).

  information: "The Pisco Punch is considered a classic cocktail, crucial to the history of San Francisco. It was invented by Duncan Nicol at a bar named Bank Exchange at the end of the 19th century, in SF; the original recipe was so potent that one writer of the day wrote *it tastes like lemonade but comes back with the kick of a roped steer.*  The drink gained notoriety thanks to pieces written by travelers including Mark Twain and Harold Ross. In Rudyard Kipling's 1889 epic *From Sea to Sea*, he immortalized Pisco Punch as being *compounded of the shavings of cherub's wings, the glory of a tropical dawn, the red clouds of sunset and the fragments of lost epics by dead masters*."

Lomasney held considerable power in the city for nearly 50 years. The story goes that the drink was created to honor his election, and the city's Ward 8 which historically delivered him a winning margin.  (You're supposed to garnish it with a miniature Massachusetts flag, too -- but those are kinda hard to chase down.)"

  information: This concoction gained popularity and was eventually served at the
    Merchants Exchange Coffee House (perhaps akin to the 'coffee shops' of Amsterdam?)
    which specifically used Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils Cognac as its base spirit. In
    1859, John Schiller acquired the Merchants Exchange Coffee House, renaming it
    to the Sazerac Coffee House and between the use of Sazerac Cognac and being served
    at the Sazerac Coffee House that this cocktail received its name. According to
    Stanley Clisby Arthur, author of the 1937 [Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to
    Mix ''Em](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0882891324?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0882891324&linkCode=xm2&tag=barback-20),
    at some point in the following decade, Leon Lamothe, a bartender at the Sazerac
    Coffee House, thought to add a dash of absinthe. Unfortunately, starting in the
    in the 1860s, Europe's vineyards were decimated by the phylloxera plague, which
    severely curtailed the availability of Cognac for the original Sazerac. It was
    around this time that the Sazerac that we know today finally took shape, as a
    Thomas (John?) H. Handy, a new owner of the Sazerac Coffee House, changed the
    base spirit from cognac to rye whiskey.

  information: While the drink''s origins are unknown, the most widely reported account
    is that it was invented in Florence, Italy in 1919, at Cafe Casoni, ex Cafe Giacosa,
    now called Cafe Cavalli. Count Camillo Negroni invented it by asking the bartender,
    Fosco Scarselli, to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano, by adding
    gin rather than the normal soda water. The bartender also added an orange garnish
    rather than the typical lemon garnish of the Americano to signify that it was
    a different drink.
