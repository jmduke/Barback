  information: 'Powdered sugar is very fine sugar which contains a small amount of
    anti-caking agent.Confectioners sugar and powdered sugar are two different terms
    for the exact same type of sugar.

    In industrial food production, it is used where a quick dissolving sugar is required.
    Domestically, it is principally used to make icing or frosting and other cake
    decorations. It is often lightly dusted onto baked goods to add a light sweetness
    and subtle decoration.

    Powdered sugar is available in different degrees of fineness , most commonly XXX,
    XXXX, and 10X, with more Xs indicating finer grains. Powdered sugar is generally
    mixed with cornstarch, wheat flour, or calcium phosphate to improve its flowing
    ability, and thus it is not generally used to sweeten beverages. Industrial grades
    without these additives are available. However, icing sugar in the UK does not
    have cornstarch or wheat flour added.

    One can make powdered sugar at home by putting normal granulated sugar in a coffee
    grinder or grinding it by hand in a mortar and pestle.

    Caster sugar (also referred to as superfine or baker''s sugar) has a larger particle
    size, up to approximately half that of granulated sugar.

    Snow powder (or snow sugar) is a non-melting form of icing sugar usually consisting
    of dextrose, starch and anti-binding agents, useful for retaining its structure
    when dusted onto cakes or pastries that require refrigeration. It is mostly used
    for decorative purposes.'

    \ is a liqueur flavored with the dried peel of the laraha citrus fruit, grown\
    \ on the island of Cura\xE7ao. A non-native plant similar to an orange, the laraha\
    \ developed from the sweet Valencia orange transplanted by Spanish explorers.\
    \ The nutrient-poor soil and arid climate of Cura\xE7ao proved unsuitable to Valencia\
    \ cultivation, resulting in small, bitter fruit of the trees. Although the bitter\
    \ flesh of the Laraha is all but inedible, the peels are aromatic and flavorful,\
    \ maintaining much of the essence of the Valencia orange.\nCura\xE7ao liqueur\
    \ was first developed and marketed by the Senior family in the 19th century. To\
    \ create the liqueur the laraha peel is dried, bringing out the sweetly fragranced\
    \ oils. After soaking in a still with alcohol and water for several days, the\
    \ peel is removed and other spices are added.\n\nThe liqueur has an orange-like\
    \ flavor with varying degrees of bitterness. It is naturally colorless, but is\
    \ often given artificial coloring, most commonly blue or orange, which confers\
    \ an exotic appearance to cocktails and other mixed drinks. Blue color is achieved\
    \ by adding of food colorant, most often E133 Brilliant Blue.\nSome other liqueurs\
    \ are also sold as Cura\xE7aos with different flavors added, such as coffee, chocolate,\

  information: 'Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color
    due to the presence of molasses. It is either an unrefined or partially refined
    soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content, or
    it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white sugar (so-called Molasses
    Sugar).

    Brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses (light brown sugar) to 6.5% molasses (dark
    brown sugar) based on total volume. Based on total weight, regular brown sugar
    contains up to 10% molasses. The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic
    nature of the molasses and is often labelled as "soft." The product may undergo
    processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling. The addition
    of dyes and/or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial
    products.

    Particle size is variable but generally less than granulated white sugar. Products
    for industrial use (e.g., the industrial production of cakes) may be based on
    caster sugar which has crystals of approximately 0.35 mm.
