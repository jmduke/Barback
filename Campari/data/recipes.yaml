  information: "The Saturn was created at the Kona Kai in Huntington Beach by J. ‚ÄúPopo‚Äù Galsini, a well-respected Tiki bartender who worked at many Orange County Polynesian restaurants from the 1950s and 60s. The Saturn cocktail was originally known as the X-15, named after the rocket plane that still holds the world record for highest speed reached by a manned, powered aircraft at 4,520 miles per hour (7,274 km/h) or Mach 6.72. According to Beachbum Berry, J. ‚ÄúPopo‚Äù Galsini named the X-15 in honor of Douglas Aircraft engineers that drank at the Kona Kai, however according to the Wikipedia article on the X-15 rocket plane it was not manufactured by Douglas Aircraft, but North American Aviation in Los Angeles, CA and Reaction Motors in New Jersey. That said, North American Aviation was initially run by James H. ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù Kindelberger, who was recruited from the Douglas Aircraft Company, so it seems possible that he brought a number of engineers along with him and that it is these engineers referenced in this story. J. ‚ÄúPopo‚Äù Galsini renamed the X-15 to the Saturn in 1967 following a tragic accident during X-15 Flight 191 resulting in the death of U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Michael J. Adams."

  ingredients:
  - 6cl Applejack
  - 1.5cl Pear Eau de Vie
  - 1.5cl Allspice Dram
  - 1.5cl Sweet vermouth
  - Angostura bitters (One dash)
  directions: "The original recipe instructs to combine all ingredients with ice and ‚Äústir like hell for no less than 30 seconds.‚Äù This is not a step to be flippant about. The large dosage of spice in this drink can turn bitter if sufficient water is not released. It also has it‚Äôs fair share of esoteric ingredients, but isn‚Äôt delicate and could probably accommodate alterations. The original recipe calls for homemade dram, but we've made due with the retail versions added to shelves recently. It also recommends the bitter Punt e Mes as a vermouth, which is a great recommendation but not required."

  information: "Historically, a R√©veillon is a dinner held late the night before Christmas. They are decadent affairs that frequently (and sometimes deliberately) contend as parties.

  information: "The test pilot is complicated, but does not require finesse. So many voices are in this choir, a couple flat notes won‚Äôt be noticed. Light and dark rums are requested, but if this drink were prepared with only one rum, angels wouldn‚Äôt lose wings (though they might kindly recommend a second rum). For bigger bars, we prefer combining a smooth, team-playing label like Plantation 3-Star with something dark and buttery, such as Smith and Cross or Goslings. If this drink takes a nose dive, it will be with absinthe, so take it easy."

  information: "A proper Seelbach is akin to a Champagne Cocktail, beefed up with some bourbon and a boatload of bitters. The amount of bitters requested in this recipe is bordering on wild, but we think it helps make sense of the bourbon, which otherwise feels a bit out of place. The finished product is spicy and effervescent, with gentian and floral notes bubbling upward over the bourbon and Cointreau. Honestly, the drink is a bit strange, but in a lovable way. Try it as a funky alternative to the traditional brunch cocktail, or to satisfy a craving for bitters and bubbly."

  information: One of the sweetest and creamiest IBA official cocktails, the Alexander acts as a nice palette cleanser or after-dinner dessert.  The original recipe back in 1915 subbed cognac for gin; the cognac variation has a number of conflicting origin stories, but the most likely source was Troy Alexander -- who created his eponymous concoction in order to serve a white drink at a dinner celebrating Phoebe Snow at Rector‚Äôs, a premier pre-Prohibition lobster shop in New York.

It was originally known as the *Milano-Torino* because of its ingredients: Campari, the bitter liqueur, is from Milan (Milano) and Punt e Mes, the vermouth, is from Turin (Torino). It is popular belief that in the early 1900s, the Italians noticed a surge of Americans who enjoyed the cocktail. As a compliment to the Americans, the cocktail later became known as the *Americano*."

  information: This concoction gained popularity and was eventually served at the
    Merchants Exchange Coffee House (perhaps akin to the 'coffee shops' of Amsterdam?)
    which specifically used Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils Cognac as its base spirit. In
    1859, John Schiller acquired the Merchants Exchange Coffee House, renaming it
    to the Sazerac Coffee House and between the use of Sazerac Cognac and being served
    at the Sazerac Coffee House that this cocktail received its name. According to
    Stanley Clisby Arthur, author of the 1937 [Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to
    Mix ''Em](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0882891324?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0882891324&linkCode=xm2&tag=barback-20),
    at some point in the following decade, Leon Lamothe, a bartender at the Sazerac
    Coffee House, thought to add a dash of absinthe. Unfortunately, starting in the
    in the 1860s, Europe's vineyards were decimated by the phylloxera plague, which
    severely curtailed the availability of Cognac for the original Sazerac. It was
    around this time that the Sazerac that we know today finally took shape, as a
    Thomas (John?) H. Handy, a new owner of the Sazerac Coffee House, changed the
    base spirit from cognac to rye whiskey.

  information: Bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler of the Clyde Common in Portland, Oregon,
    created the Flannel Shirt for an autumnal event. Using classic fall flavors --

    Fosco Scarselli, to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano, by adding
