    "description": "barback (n) — a bartender's assistant; they are there to simplify a bartender's job; bussing tables and dishwashing are common duties. In some establishments, barbacks may also be responsible for the safety of the bartender.\n\nBrowse from a great selection of over one hundred cocktails, featuring recipes new and old. Search by ingredients or by name; save your favorites and even generate a shopping list so you never go dry.\n\nNew recipes added weekly -- and, like any good bartender, we're hard at work to make your next drink the best one. (Not that anything will beat a Manhattan.)\n\nFor connoisseurs and novices alike, filled to the brim with modern and classic cocktails — Barback.\n\nHappy bartending, friends.",
    "version_whats_new": "NEW FEATURES!:\n- Introduce ABVs for ingredients and beverages, so you can be informed about just how strong that Alabama Slammer is.\n- Introduce additional information for recipes: origins, etymology, fun facts, that kind of thing.  (We'll be backfilling these for older recipes over the next few months.)\n- Some tiny layout changes to make it more intuitive to share recipes.\n- Better recommendations for imperial units, so you don't have to guess what a third of an ounce of rye looks like. \n\nNERD STUFF!:\n- Migrate data to Parse, so we can push exciting new recipes and such.\n- Lots of analytics.  (Nothing too creepy.  Just making sure the app doesn't crash and such.)\n- Migrate all icons to SVGs, which is neat.\n- Seriously, so much refactoring.",
